# Deep-learning-for-detecting-pneumonia-from-x-ray-images

Using convolutional neural network to detect if a patient has pneumonia or not using x-ray samples of their chests.

Used dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia for computations. For the given dataset the model has achieved 90% accuracy on training set and 87% accuracy on test set.

Note: Dataset, chest_xray, and cnn.py file should be the same folder for the code to run.
